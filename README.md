Yamba
=====

Rewrite of Marko Gargenta's Yamba application from the book "Nauƒçite Android" (don't know original title) 
using ANDROID STUDIO instead of Eclipse. My rewrite is not direct copy of that Yamba. 
The sole purpose of this app and it's repo is self-learning Android programming (on two computers, that is) 
and GitHub using.
